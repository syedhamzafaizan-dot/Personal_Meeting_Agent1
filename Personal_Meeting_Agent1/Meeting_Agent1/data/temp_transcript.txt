[00:00] Emily: Customer feedback strongly requests CSV export.
[00:30] Isabella: Support sees this request weekly.
[01:00] James: Let's do a lightweight version first.
[01:30] Oliver: Backend endpoint is required.
[02:00] William: Frontend is trivial once API exists.
[02:30] Michael: Do we need analytics?
[02:50] Emma: Yes, we should track export usage.
[03:15] James: Decision: ship CSV export behind a feature flag.
[03:45] Emily: We need a rollout one-pager for support and sales.
[04:10] James: Can someone own that by next Friday?
[04:30] Emily: I can, but need confirmation from support.
[05:00] Isabella: I'll review messaging once draft is ready.
[05:30] Daniel: Analytics events should be defined by end of week.
[06:00] Emma: I can define events if backend fields are known.
[06:30] Oliver: Endpoint will be done by the 15th.
[07:00] Henry: Security review needed before enabling flag for all users.
[07:30] Michael: Let's not block release, but flag the risk.
[08:00] James: Who owns security review?
[08:20] Henry: I'll do an initial pass next week.
[08:50] William: Do we need export limits?
[09:10] Sophia: Rate limiting might be needed.
[09:40] James: Add as risk for now.
[10:10] James: Demo planned in two weeks.
[10:40] Emily: Okay, aligning timelines.
