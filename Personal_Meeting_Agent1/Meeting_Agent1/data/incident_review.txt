[00:00] James: Post-incident review for yesterday's payment failures.
[00:30] Sophia: Primary issue was a retry storm after partial timeout.
[01:00] Daniel: DB connection pool was exhausted shortly after retries spiked.
[01:30] Michael: So retries triggered DB pressure?
[01:50] Sophia: Yes, retries amplified the issue.
[02:20] James: Logs were missing during the peak—why?
[02:45] Daniel: Logging service crashed under load.
[03:10] Sophia: We had no alert for missing logs.
[03:40] James: Action items—fix retry policy and add log alerts.
[04:10] Sophia: I'll update retry and backoff config by tomorrow EOD.
[04:40] Daniel: I'll add alerts for missing logs by Monday.
[05:10] James: Who contacts the payment vendor about outage credits?
[05:40] (silence)
[06:00] James: Okay, I'll take it, but remind me if I forget.
[06:30] Henry: Security note—we should review retry logic for abuse risk.
[07:00] Michael: Good call, but probably next sprint.
[07:30] Sophia: Decision: keep circuit breaker enabled permanently.
[08:00] Emma: Do we need post-incident metrics for reporting?
[08:25] James: Yes, but let's add to backlog.
[08:50] Daniel: Risk—we still don't load-test payment workers.
[09:20] Michael: If no owner, backlog it.
[09:45] James: Agreed. Any other issues?
[10:10] Sophia: None from SRE.
[10:30] James: Okay, wrapping up.
